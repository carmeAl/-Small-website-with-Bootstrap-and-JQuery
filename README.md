# Small-website-with-Bootstrap-and-JQuery
Implement a simple website with Bootstrap and JQuery
- Asks for a github username
- Show a table with the repositories of the selected user with (at least): name, description, number of followers
- The design is not really important but should use bootstrap components
- The input box for the username can be in the same page or can be two pages: one for asking the name and other for showing the repositories
